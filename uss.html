    <p class="text-center fw-medium">Elvira dreams of marrying Prince Julian, and is finally handed an opportunity to achieve her dream when the Prince throws a ball. She is ridiculed for not being seen as conventially attractive by society around her, only made worse by her new beautiful stepsister also attending the ball. She goes to great lengths to conform to the beauty standards around her.</p>

    <p class="text-center fw-medium">Going into this film, I knew the general idea. A pyschological/body horror version of Cinderella based around the unattainable beauty standards women are held to. On paper, it's a good fit and an interesting way to readapt a story we've seen so many times. And it's successful in excecution too! </p>

    <p class="text-center fw-medium"> I think what works about the film is how scarce the actual horror can be. It's a lot of drama and build up, but then when it hits, they go hard on the grotesque and nasty. Plenty of gore to make you squeamish. Another aspect of the movie I was quite impressed with was the direction they took the story. The main character herself is not a stand-in for Cinderella, but rather one of the stepsisters. The abuse of the stepmother was apparent through the eyes of the victim who was feeling the full brunt of it, but seeing it through the eyes of encouragment and lofty standards was an interesting angle to take and it paid off well in the long run.</p>

    <p class="text-center fw-medium"> Lea Mathilde Skar-Myren is the lead and she hits a perfect balance of empathetic and crazy. She's walking a line where she has to do some crazy stuff, but we also still have to feel bad for her, and her performance hits the nail on the head. It's not a particularly subtle film thematically, but that's by design and I think it works. It's shot nicely, with some very nice makeup and outfits. A solid cast overall, great gore, entertaining characters. A really solid time, give it a shot if you have Shudder! </p>
