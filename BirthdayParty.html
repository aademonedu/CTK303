            <p>The song that was #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on my birthday was the song Yeah! by Usher featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris. I've linked the song on the left side of my page, right below this message, or click on the image to load the music video for the song. I also linked the Shrek 2 trailer below to prove I can embed videos, I would've chosen something more relevant but youtube will not let me embed any video with the song in it to this page. Enjoy! </p>

            <h3>Yeah! biography</h3>
            <p> Yeah! was released on January 10, 2004 as the lead single for Usher's fourth studio album Confessions. It was recorded in late 2003, when the label listened to the album and felt none of the tracks waranted being a strong lead single. When it came out, the song spent 12 consecutive weeks at #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 Chart, and it was the longest running song at #1 of 2004.  </p>
